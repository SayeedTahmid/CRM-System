## 10. AI Development Considerations

Since you're building with an AI co-pilot, here are specific considerations:

### 10.1 Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns (auth, customer, logs, complaints, etc.)
- **Clear File Structure**: 
  ```
  /backend (Python)
    /api
    /models
    /services
    /utils
  /frontend (React)
    /components
    /pages
    /services
    /hooks
    /utils
  /mobile (Kotlin)
    /app
      /data
      /domain
      /presentation
  ```

### 10.2 Documentation
- **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- **README files**: Setup instructions for each component
- **Type Definitions**: Use TypeScript for frontend, type hints for Python

### 10.3 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: For business logic
- **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: For critical user flows
- **Test Data**: Seed data for development/testing

### 10.4 Iteration Approach
- Build feature-by-feature, not layer-by-layer
- Start with backend API → frontend UI → integration
- Test each feature before moving to next
- Use Firebase emulators for local development

## 11. Success Metrics & KPIs

### 11.1 User Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- User retention rate (weekly, monthly)
- Feature adoption rate
- Time spent in app

### 11.2 Performance Metrics
- Average page load time
- API response time (p95, p99)
- Search latency
- Sync delay (emails, calls)

### 11.3 Business Metrics
- Customer records per user
- Logs created per day
- Complaint resolution time
- Email auto-categorization accuracy
- Chatbot deflection rate (queries handled without escalation)

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

### 12.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Firebase costs exceed budget | High | Monitor usage, implement pagination, optimize queries |
| Gmail API quota limits | Medium | Implement rate limiting, use batch requests, queue processing |
| VoIP integration complexity | High | Start with simpler solution (Twilio), detailed integration planning |
| Multi-tenancy data leakage | Critical | Rigorous testing, security audit, tenant filters on all queries |
| NLP/Chatbot accuracy issues | Medium | Start with rule-based, gradually add ML, user feedback loop |

### 12.2 Operational Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data loss | Critical | Daily backups, redundancy, disaster recovery plan |
| Service downtime | High | Health monitoring, alerts, rollback procedures |
| Security breach | Critical | Regular security audits, encryption, access controls |
