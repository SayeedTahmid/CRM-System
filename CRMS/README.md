✅ **Define scope** - Specifies what's included (and what's not) to prevent feature creep  
✅ **Guide development** - Provides detailed functional and non-functional requirements  
✅ **Measure success** - Outlines KPIs and metrics to evaluate product goals  
✅ **Reduce misunderstandings** - Documents assumptions, dependencies, and edge cases upfront
