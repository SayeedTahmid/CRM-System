## ⚠️ What This Means

### Risks with 8-Week Timeline

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Technical debt accumulates** | Document debt, plan cleanup sprints post-launch |
| **Quality may suffer** | Allocate full week (Week 8) for testing |
| **Team burnout** | Mandatory breaks, celebrate milestones |
| **Scope creep** | Ruthless scope control, no additions allowed |
| **Feature requests during dev** | Log for Phase 5+, do not add to current scope |

### Success Requirements

**Team:**
- ✅ 2-3 experienced full-stack developers (React + Python + Firebase)
- ✅ Full-time commitment (no other projects, 40+ hours/week)
- ✅ Developers comfortable working independently
- ✅ Daily standups (15 minutes, no exceptions)

**Process:**
- ✅ Ruthless prioritization (only P0 features in each phase)
- ✅ Daily progress tracking (burndown chart)
- ✅ Immediate blocker resolution (< 2 hours)
- ✅ Minimal code reviews (async, < 30 min turnaround)
- ✅ Manual testing only (automated tests post-launch)

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Firebase project pre-configured before Day 1
- ✅ Gmail API credentials ready before Week 3
- ✅ Twilio account setup before Week 7
- ✅ n8n instance running before Week 3
- ✅ Development environments ready (no setup time during sprint)
